<h1> What Factors Contribute to the Under-representation of Black Individuals Working in Tech Careers in the Greater Toronto Area? </h1>

<p>This written piece will dive into what factors exactly contribute to the lack of black representation we see in technology, especially in the GTA, the data collection tools I was able to utilize, and any other vital pieces of information I was able to gain throughout the journey of my data collection. </p>

<p><strong>By: Idris Hersi</strong></p>

<h2> Research Approach and Method </h2>

<p>When it came to my overall research approach, my focus was to gather quantitative data, and the data collection tool I used to make this happen was a survey. In my survey, I added a blend of demographic questions to gain more insight into the background of my participants and went more into detail in order to find out exactly why my participants believed that we don't see enough representation in the tech force.

<h2> Demographic Survey Question Results</h2>
<p>
This section will cover the results I was able to gather through the demographic questions in my survey I posed to my participants.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, in order to gain insight into how my participants identify, I asked a variety of demographic-based questions, which included:
</p>

<ul>
<li> How would you describe your gender?</li>
<li>What ethnic backgrounds do you associate with?</li>
<li>Do you currently reside or grew up in the Greater Toronto Area?</li>
<li>From the current list provided, where does your age fall under?</li>
</ul>
<p>
These demographic-based questions I was able to ask really helped in specifying my research because I was able to find out whether my participants currently reside or grew up in the GTA, which is important since my research question was specifically looking at tech careers in the GTA. I was able to identify the crowd I wanted to look more into by asking them to identify their ethnic backgrounds because my research was focused on the black community as a whole. With the age-guided question I asked, I was able to gain more of an insight into whether my participants had a decent amount of work experience when it came to working in tech-related roles. When it came to the gender question I posed, I really wanted to find out exactly how my participants identified themselves, because your very own identity consists of many different things. This will be talked about later on in the article, but I was also interested in seeing if there was a lack of diversity shown through gender barriers that are currently in place.
</p>



<p>
Out of the 6 participants who participated in my survey, 83.3% were male and 16.7% were female.

<h2>
Factor Based Questions
</h2>

<p>
Even though I, personally, do have some overall knowledge of the lack of representation of black individuals working in tech careers overall, I specifically wanted to gain more of an overall idea of why this might be the case, and I thought that being able to hear what my participants think would be a great idea overall.
</p>

<p>
I first needed to ask some opinion- and knowledge-based questions to gain a better understanding of why we don't see diversity in this space, as well as some recommendation-based questions about what public institutions should do to combat the issue at hand.
</p>

<p>
Some of these questions include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I personally believe that there is a high representation of Black individuals working in higher-up roles at tech corporations</li>
<li>What are some reasons why you believe that we do not see as much black representation in the technology industry in the GTA?</li>
<li>Do you believe that not having too much Black representation (eg. in the workplace and even social media) negatively impacts Black students decision when it comes to deciding whether to work in the tech industry?</li>
<li>What recommendations would you make to school boards across the GTA like the TDSB when it comes to pushing out more programs and after-school initiatives related to Black youth who are interested in learning more about technology?</li>
</ul>

<p>
I started off by asking if they personally believe that there is an overall high representation of black individuals working in tech in the GTA, and 66.7% voted strongly disagree and 33.3% voted disagree, which is clear to say that black professionals who currently work in tech careers do not believe there is a solid representation at the moment. This point can even be backed up by statistics that have been gathered through some post-secondary institutions.
</p>

<p>
(<em>Overall opinion on Black representation shown through a diagram</em>)
</p>

<p>
From a study that was done in 2016 by Brookfield Institute, it revealed that Black individuals only make up about 2.6% of the tech workforce in Canada. They're also the lowest paid as well, which can be demonstrated through a variety of industrial biases shown throughout the workplace. Not to mention, as well, that 3.5% of the Canadian population is composed of Black people. This just goes to show that there is still work to be done. <a href="https://brookfieldinstitute.ca/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-Tech-Workers-ONLINE.pdf"> Here is the link to the Brookfield Institute research they've conducted. </a>
</p>


<p>
In order to find more factors why there's an under-representation of black individuals in this career space, I asked participants, "What are some reasons why you believe that we do not see as much black representation in the technology industry in the GTA?" This question that I asked in my survey was an open-ended question, so I was able to give my participants the opportunity to give their personal take on this situation.
</p>

<p>
Some common reasons that were brought up included:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of exposure to opportunities in tech</li>
<li>Mentorship opportunities</li>
<li>Systemic racism and institutional bias</li>
<li>Streotypes and common misconceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was nice to see a lot of common points being brought up in the survey, and every single point that was brought up is extremely valid because, even in my case, I never knew about any mentorship opportunities around my area or even my school community, and without the BlackMINT mentorship that I've gone through, I'm not too sure if I would have even considered working in technology as a career option. It just goes to show you that being able to see people who look like you succeed in a career path you're interested in boosts your confidence greatly.
</p>

<p>
When I asked my participants if they believed that "not having too much Black representation (e.g. in the workplace and even social media) negatively impacts Black students' decisions when it comes to deciding whether to work in the tech industry?" 66.7% said they agree, 16.7% said they strongly agree, and 16.7% voted neutral. Based on the responses we received for this question, it appears that the majority of those who took part in this survey agree that a lack of representation can deter people from entering the space.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
I personally started to consider one factor on my own that can be shown through course selection and guidance overall in schools at the high school level. This factor that we'll dive into is called applied streaming.
</p>

<p>
In Ontario, there are two main titles that go under courses that are run in classrooms in high school: academic and applied. When it comes down to it, you'll learn the same course whether in academic or applied, but the "difficulty" you choose can vary for future choices you have to make after high school or even when planning future courses throughout the rest of your high school tenure. Academic courses are needed in order to apply to university or college level programs, while with applied courses, your university options will be very limited if that's the route you're interested in taking.
</p>

<p>
However, one thing that must be noted is that starting in September of 2022, Ontario is going to end grade 9 academic and applied streaming. This is a move in the right direction because now incoming students entering high school won't be divided into different classes, so to speak. In an article written by CP24, it states that "advocates have long argued that streaming ends up dividing students rather than providing them more options and disproportionately impacts racialized and low-income students." This is a very good point that was brought up because even though these academic and applied course selections won't be emphasised throughout Ontario schools anymore, it's not like it fixes everything entirely, since students who've already passed grade 9 could have potentially been affected by this, not to mention black tech professionals working in fields today. <a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/ontario-will-end-grade-9-academic-and-applied-streaming-in-september-2022-1.5661632?cache=qhrreidjy"> Here is a link to that very same CP24 article </a>
</p>

<p>
In order to gain more of an understanding of how my participants felt about this topic, I asked two close-ended questions related to this topic:
</p>

<ul>
<li>On a scale of 1-5, how serious do you think applied streaming in high school is towards Black students? (5 being the highest option)</li>
<li>Referring back to the previous question, do you believe that this can be a key reason in why we don't see as many black individuals working in tech roles?</li>
</ul>

<p>
On a scale of 1–5, 33.3% of participants voted 4, 16.7% voted 5, and 50% voted 3, which in this case would be neutral.
</p>

</p>

<p>
When asked if they believe that this could possibly be a key reason why we don't see that much black representation in tech careers in the GTA, 50% voted neutral, 33.3% voted agree, and 16.7% voted strongly agree.

<h2>
Potential Recommendations
</h2>

<p>
Towards the end of my survey, I asked my participants 3 questions in order to ask them personally what they think should be done in school boards to support Black youth wanting to pursue careers in technology and any after-school programs that they believe enable that engagement that's needed for the black community.
</p>

<p>
These three questions included:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you believe that there are enough extracurriculars centered around Black youth who want to pursue careers in technology?</li>
<li>Are there any current after-school technology mentorship or workshops that you would recommend to Black youth that are interested in learning more about technology?</li>
<li>What recommendations would you make to school boards across the GTA like the TDSB when it comes to pushing out more programs and after-school initiatives related to Black youth who are interested in learning more about technology?</li>
</ul>

<p>
When it came to the results gained over whether they think there are enough extracurricular activities out there, 100% voted no to this question. This makes a lot of sense in the grand scheme of things, because coming from a black teen who's interested in technology, I've never heard of many programs that are centred around black youth who want to pursue careers in technology. This needs to be a big point of concern because we only make up 2.6% of the tech workforce in Canada, and by enabling more after-school programs catered to our community, we'll be able to see more change overall.
</p>

<p>
(<em>The lack of technology extracurriculars that are targetted towards the black community question results shown through a circular diagram.</em>)
</p>


<p>
I wanted to know more about any current opportunities that Black youth can access right now, so I asked my participants if they could recommend any programs that enable this kind of experience. 60% added BlackMINT; the organization that I worked at for my BSSLP (Black Student Summer Leadership Program) placement, 20% added Black Boys Code, and the other 20% said that they're not sure of any programs that do exist like that at that given moment.
</p>

<p>
(<em>Recommended after-school program results shown through a bar diagram.</em>)
</p>



<p>
I thought that it was great to see another program out there that I didn't know about. This given information is able to broaden your own understanding of some alternative programs Black youth can gain access to, and it also just goes to show that there aren't too many programs that are catered to black youth who are interested in pursuing careers in technology. It was able to reinforce the point that was mentioned even more.
</p>

<p>
When it came to recommendations that needed to be heard, I asked my participants at the very end of the survey, "What recommendations would you make to school boards across the GTA like the TDSB when it comes to pushing out more programs and after-school initiatives related to Black youth who are interested in learning more about technology?" I wanted to delve deeper into this topic because, while we were able to identify a number of factors that contribute to this issue, I wanted to learn more about what schools across the GTA can do to address the issue at hand.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't agree more with the recommendations that were given because when it comes to guest speakers and mentorship opportunities, this can essentially boost your pride in a sense. If you're able to see people who look just like you succeed in technology, that will give you the courage to go on that journey route. Guest speakers, mentorships, and forming partnerships all relate back to networking. Not a lot of people tend to think this through, but networking is something that's really important in society. Without building relationships, you'll have trouble seeking out help. For guidance and even potential work opportunities, students will have the opportunity to connect with guest speakers and their mentors on their own time.
</p>

<p>
Since this question was optional to answer, we were only able to receive about 3 responses, since it was in fact a long answer. Some topics that were brought up include the need for more series and guest speakers to visit schools and get the chance to talk to students, more specifically in inner-city areas; more hack-a-thons; access to mentorship opportunities; and forming partnerships with tech companies for internships.
</p>

<h2>
Similarities and Differences Found
</h2>

<p>
Through my data collection, I observed lots of similarities between the answers given by my participants, but I also noticed a lot of differences throughout the journey as well.
</p>

<p>
At the very start of my survey, I asked the participants if they could identify their gender because I wanted to see if there was potentially a lack of representation shown for a particular gender in tech careers in the GTA. I wasn't sure at the start if I would have been able to find substantial differences, but out of the 6 participants who participated in the survey, only 16.7% identified as female. This actually showed me that there's another issue that needs to be addressed, the lack of females that work in tech careers in the GTA. Even though the results that were gained through the survey don't necessarily represent the entire tech community since there were only 6 participants who participated in the original survey, it's still something that needs to be talked about and I think it's great that I was able to point out another problem. The same thing can also be said for the representation shown by afro-indigenous individuals working in the field because only 16.7% identified as Afro-Indigenous in the survey.

</p>



<p>
Another three similarities I noticed between my participants included age, the highest level or degrees acquired throughout their school career, and current employment status. 100% said that the highest level of education they have completed was a master's degree; 100% are currently working full-time; and 83.3% are between the ages of 25-35.
